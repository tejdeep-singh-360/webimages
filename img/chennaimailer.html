  Dear $contact_name,<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
    Greetings of the day !<br />
    As discussed, i am sending you the details of the Chennai programme and attaching the profile of Faculty Members.<br /><br />As we all know that since Oct 2012 as per NABL guidelines, it has become mandatory for the quality manager of a lab, to get trained in an internal auditor&rsquo;s course for ISO-15189 before applying for NABL accreditation. It is also essential for the pathologists, microbiologists, biochemists &amp; technicians, of all the clinical labs who want to follow quality protocols, to understand this international standard. With increasing demand, we felt the need of conducting internal auditor&rsquo;s course at your doorstep.<br /><br />This course is designed keeping in mind requirements of NABL that all NABL accredited/to be accredited laboratories are required to comply with revised and new standard i.e. ISO 15189:2012 before October 2015. All laboratories accredited till date as per previous version are required to ensure compliance with the revised version when they are reassessed during scheduled Surveillance/Reassessment audits or as a separate assessment.<br /><br />For the convenience of the participants these courses are being organized under a program named "Health Education &amp; Learning Protocols" (HELP) in collaboration with "Quality Council of India" under the guidance of Dr.Ms.J. Bhatia (NABL Assessor and member of Quality Council of India).<br /><br /><br /><br />Candidates will get the certificate of completion of the course.</p>
